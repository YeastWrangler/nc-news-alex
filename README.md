# Welcome to my news site built using React

This app provides a UI to access an API of articles, comments and users. The articles can be filtered by topic and can be further sorted by date, number of votes, or number of comments. Users can also post comments to individual articles and can upvote or downvote specific articles. If a user has posted a comment they can also delete their comments.
